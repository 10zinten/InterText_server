-> version 2.2
==============

- you need EITHER to have MySQL version >= 5.6 OR to turn off fulltext searches
explicitly by inserting '$DISABLE_FULLTEXT = true;' into your config.php - 
this must be decided/solved FIRST OF ALL!
- it is highly suggested to use the option innodb_file_per_table in your 
MySQL configuration (usually in /etc/mysql/my.cnf, see the database 
documentation)
- ensure that you have no upper size limit set for the main tablespace 
in innodb_data_file_path and that you have enough space available on your disk;
the file may grow by several gigabytes even when using
innodb_file_per_table and if it hits a size limit, you may get into troubles with
the conversion process (below); the database will also grow significantly in
size after conversion
- in order to make the new transaction support effective on existing data,
you need to run the script 'update-2.2.php', which will convert all
existing tables into the InnoDB format (and remove fulltext indexes if 
fulltext is disabled in config.php) - this conversion is NOT neccessary for
InterText to run, but until you convert the tables, the transactions will 
silently be ineffective for all texts existing before the update 
(and even for newly added translations of those texts!) - this conversion should
in theory be safe to do on a running system, but making back-ups before any 
change is always highly recommended!

version 1.7 -> version 2.0
==========================
- before updating, the database must be updated by running the
'update-2.0.php' script
- new options need to be added to settings.php

version 1.4 -> version 1.5
==========================
- before updating, the database must be updated by running the
'update-1.5.sql' script in MySQL
- additional changes in settings.php may apply
